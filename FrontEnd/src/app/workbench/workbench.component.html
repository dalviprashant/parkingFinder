      'SmartPark' is the private company whose motivation is to reduce the human efforts to find parking spots.
      This idea is sponsored by Vishwakarma Institute of Information Technology,Kondhwa,Pune,Maharashtra.
      Smart Parking is a system for pre-booking parking spots considering the
      location and nearby parking spots available.

      experienced by the citizens while searching for a parking spot.

      Cameras will be installed at each parking area which will sense any incoming
      and outgoing vehicle, capture the vehicle number and using an IoT device the
      gate will open only if the captured number is present in the database.
      If the vehicle number on number plate is not clearly visible then it will
      hinder the working of our system.

      A waiting list will be created if parking spots are not available and the users will
      be notified as soon as the parking spot becomes free.
      The in-time and out-time will be used to calculate the parking charges.
      Users will use the application to book parking slot and all the details about user
      and vehicle(vehicle no.) will be stored to the database.
